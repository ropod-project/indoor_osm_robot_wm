# Preset files
In OSM every object is defined by two things - first, its geometry and second, its attributes which come in the form of tags. 

Preset files are used to automatically apply specific tags to the object in JOSM (official OSM editing software)

# How to use preset files
* Open JOSM and go to Preset-> Preset preferences
* Click on map settings tab
* Now select tagging presets
* To add new preset file click on add(+) button beside active presets
* Enter the location of preset file
* All the new models should be now available under presets->ROPOD option!
